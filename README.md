# LipNet

LipNet is a deep neural network designed for lipreading, which involves understanding speech by observing lip movements. This project utilizes convolutional and recurrent neural networks to recognize spoken words from video inputs of lip movements.

## 1. Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
!pip install opencv-python matplotlib imageio gdown
```

## 2. Data Loading Functions

The data loading functions are responsible for loading videos and their corresponding alignments, preprocessing them, and preparing them for training. Functions like load_video and load_alignments are implemented for this purpose.

## 3. Data Pipeline
The data pipeline section sets up the pipeline for loading and preprocessing the data using TensorFlow's Dataset API. It includes functions for mapping and batching the data.

## 4. Designing the Neural Network
In this section, the architecture of the LipNet model is defined. It consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction from video frames, followed by bidirectional LSTM layers for temporal modeling.

## 5. Training
The training process is explained here. It includes setting up training options, defining the loss function, scheduling learning rates, and training the model. The ProduceExample callback is used to display predictions after each epoch.

## 6. Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, predictions can be made on new data. This section demonstrates how to make predictions using the trained model on test data.

## 7. Testing on a Video
Finally, the model's performance is tested on a video input. The lip movements are processed, and predictions are made to understand how well the model performs on real-world data.
